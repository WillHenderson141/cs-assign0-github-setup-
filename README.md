About Me
This is my first program and use of github and plan of using it far more throughout my career. This checklist provides a physical list of items needed to complete the assignment.
Please reach out if you have any advice and tips that would help me in future.

CIS 212 assignment to set-up a git hub environment
- [x] GitHub account active
- [x] 2FA enabled (app-based)
- [x] Profile updated (name, avatar, short bio)
- [x] git version (2.51.0) installed
- [x] git config William Henderson/whenderson10@student.ccc.edu
- [x] git ssh key (Hi WillHenderson141! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.)

REFLECTION 
Once I realized the differnt programs I would need everything went over smoothly although hands down the easiest part is setting up the account and the two step authentication. The confusing part to me was dealing with the ssh-key because I had to turn ssh on and then automate it. Through this process however I leared more about git bash and how to operate within that CLI.
